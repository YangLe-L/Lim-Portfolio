## A. Wireframe/Storyboard

## B. User Research 
I am targetting these types of audiences and its corresponding call-to-action 
* Heinz course classmates
  * If they join the healthcare industry, use the skills that they learned (e.g. analytics) in Heinz to help their employers (public and private) avoid healthcare waste spending.
  * Create a business solution to solve a particular waste in the healthcare industry. 
* Citizens who may or may not be engaged with current affairs
  * Lobby the legislators to tackle a specific waste problem at the federal or local level.  
* Healthcare industry practitioners
  * Persuading them to play a part in changing old practices as the waste problem is getting too serious   

I interviewed Heinz students of various background who act as a proxy for the various audiences. Any Heinz student can represent the citizens. Those students from the healthcare management degree can help to derive insights for the healthcare industry practitioners  The questions will primarily be focusing on the logical flow and the persuasiveness of the storyline to inspire action. 

### Questions     
 * *Can you describe to me what the storyline is telling you?*  
 * *Assuming the content is complete and accurate, does the content (visualizations/text) support its title?*   
 * *Does the storyline flow smoothly? Is there is a problem with the arrangement of the cards?*  
 * *Who do you think is the intended audience? If this is not clear, are there ways to make it clearer?*  
 * *Do you think the storyline is persuasive enough to inspire action in the intended audience? If it is not persuasive, are there modifications that you would recommend?*  
 * *Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?*  
 * *Is there anything you would change or do differently?*   
 * *Is there any additional information you would like to know?*  
 * *Imagine that you are working in the healthcare industry, do you think that the storyline is persuasive enough to inspire you to take action? (for the person who had worked in the healthcare sector)*
