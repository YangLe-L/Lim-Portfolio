## A. Wireframe/Storyboard

## B. User Research 
I am targetting these types of audiences. 
* Heinz course classmates/Citizens who may or may not be engaged with current affairs
* Healthcare industry practitioners
* Legislators  

I interviewed Heinz students of various background who act as a proxy for the various audiences. The questions will primarily be focusing on the logical flow and the persuasiveness of the storyline to inspire action. 

Questions     
 * *Can you describe to me what the storyline is telling you?*  
 * *Assuming the content is complete and accurate, does the content (visualizations/text) support its title?*   
 * *Does the storyline flow smoothly? Is there is a problem with the arrangement of the cards?*  
 * *Who do you think is the intended audience? If this is not clear, are there ways to make it clearer?*  
 * *Do you think the storyline is persuasive enough to inspire action in the intended audience? If it is not persuasive, are there modifications that you would recommend?*  
 * *Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?*  
 * *Is there anything you would change or do differently?*   
 * *Is there any additional information you would like to know?*  
 * *Imagine that you are working in the healthcare industry, do you think that the storyline is persuasive enough to inspire you to take action? (for the person who had worked in the healthcare sector)*  

#### 1st Person: Heinz student studying healthcare management who has worked in the healthcare industry before (proxy for audience in the healthcare industry)

#### 2nd Person: Heinz student studying public policy who has no particular interest in healthcare (proxy for classmates and citizens)   

Question     | Answer 
------------ | -------------
Can you describe to me what the storyline is telling you?  | The storyline is telling me that the US healthcare system is inefficient. It is losing a huge amount of money and it could be avoided with action is taken. 
Assuming the content is complete and accurate, does the content (visualizations/text) support its title?| Yes, I think the content and the graphs match the title of each card. 
Does the storyline flow smoothly? Is there is a problem with the arrangement of the cards? | Yes, I think each card builds on the past one and allows the viewer to see the argument about why it is important to act on stopping waste in the US healthcare system. 
Who do you think is the intended audience? If this is not clear, are there ways to make it clearer? | I think that policymakers in Congress or the Senate are the intended audiences. I think this does a good job of reaching them. 
Do you think the storyline is persuasive enough to inspire action in the intended audience? If it is not persuasive, are there modifications that you would recommend? |	I do think that the storyline is persuasive. It does a good job of building the argument and taking the viewer step-by-step through the logic of the argument. It does inspire action because it shows how much money is being wasted everyday action is not taken. 
Is there anything you find surprising or confusing? | I think the amount wasted by the healthcare system is surprising. But, I think this point is made in a logical way.
Is there anything you would change or do differently? | I donâ€™t think so, I think the order of the cards makes sense and if you have the graphs then it would be a solid presentation. 
Is there any additional information you would like to know? | I would like to know how by how much US health care costs would drop without waste. The third slide shows a bar graph with the first bar that represents US health care costs and the second with a bar that shows US healthcare costs without waste. It would be helpful to know the numerical difference between the first bar and the second bar. Also, If the colors of waste could be added to the first part of the bar graph that could be a helpful visual.
