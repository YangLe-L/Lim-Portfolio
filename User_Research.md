## 2nd Person: Heinz student studying public policy who has no particular interest in healthcare (proxy for classmates and citizens)   

Question     | Answer 
------------ | -------------
Can you describe to me what the storyline is telling you?  | The storyline is telling me that the US healthcare system is inefficient. It is losing a huge amount of money and it could be avoided with action is taken. 
Assuming the content is complete and accurate, does the content (visualizations/text) support its title?| Yes, I think the content and the graphs match the title of each card. 
Does the storyline flow smoothly? Is there is a problem with the arrangement of the cards? | Yes, I think each card builds on the past one and allows the viewer to see the argument about why it is important to act on stopping waste in the US healthcare system. 
Who do you think is the intended audience? If this is not clear, are there ways to make it clearer? | I think that policymakers in Congress or the Senate are the intended audiences. I think this does a good job of reaching them. 
Do you think the storyline is persuasive enough to inspire action in the intended audience? If it is not persuasive, are there modifications that you would recommend? |	I do think that the storyline is persuasive. It does a good job of building the argument and taking the viewer step-by-step through the logic of the argument. It does inspire action because it shows how much money is being wasted everyday action is not taken. 
Is there anything you find surprising or confusing? | I think the amount wasted by the healthcare system is surprising. But, I think this point is made in a logical way.
Is there anything you would change or do differently? | I don’t think so, I think the order of the cards makes sense and if you have the graphs then it would be a solid presentation. 
Is there any additional information you would like to know? | I would like to know how by how much US health care costs would drop without waste. The third slide shows a bar graph with the first bar that represents US health care costs and the second with a bar that shows US healthcare costs without waste. It would be helpful to know the numerical difference between the first bar and the second bar. Also, If the colors of waste could be added to the first part of the bar graph that could be a helpful visual.   

## 3rd Person: Heinz student studying public policy who has no particular interest in healthcare (proxy for classmates and citizens) 

Question     | Answer 
------------ | -------------
Can you describe to me what the storyline is telling you?  | The U.S. is spending too much money on health care compared to other countries but are not getting proportionate results. This is due to inefficiencies and poor allocation of money. Action should be implemented quickly to fix this because millions of dollars are wasted for every moment we don’t act.
Assuming the content is complete and accurate, does the content (visualizations/text) support its title?| The content of each card clearly supports the title of each card.
Does the storyline flow smoothly? Is there is a problem with the arrangement of the cards? | For the most part, it is okay. I would have preferred for the term “waste” to be elaborated before the implication of it was described. Maybe if card 5 was presented earlier, or if  a clear definition was stated before the numbers, the graphs would have made a better impact.
Who do you think is the intended audience? If this is not clear, are there ways to make it clearer? | The intended audience are Heinz students.
Do you think the storyline is persuasive enough to inspire action in the intended audience? If it is not persuasive, are there modifications that you would recommend? | I think it’s persuasive enough given the limit of the length and type of the presentation.
Is there anything you find surprising or confusing? | The term “waste” should have been defined earlier in the presentation.
Is there anything you would change or do differently? | See question 3 (did storyline flow smoothly)
Is there any additional information you would like to know? | Maybe a clearer call to action. Is it to lobby for cutting down costs? Changing the infrastructure for healthcare? Elimination jobs? 


## 4th Person: Heinz student studying public policy who has no particular interest in healthcare (proxy for classmates and citizens) 

Question     | Answer 
------------ | -------------
Can you describe to me what the storyline is telling you?  | How much the U.S. Healthcare system wastes and how it negatively impacts the costs the US has in comparison to other countries (as a percentage of GDP).  
Assuming the content is complete and accurate, does the content (visualizations/text) support its title?| Yes; however, some cards can be improved. The concept of Healthcare expenditure is a bit unclear. Consumer expenditure? Government spending? It should be clarified a bit to understand the nature of costs here, as we see later on in the slidedeck the portion of interventions focused on public sector choices. 
Does the storyline flow smoothly? Is there is a problem with the arrangement of the cards? | I think it does a pretty good job at flowing. I see a scaffolding of ideas based on previous assertions, and the right types of expansions on implications and framing statistics. For example, the portion explaining what that type of loss means for each individual and what it affords them was a powerful explanation/point. 
Who do you think is the intended audience? If this is not clear, are there ways to make it clearer? | I think it’s a bit unclear as it says act now yet the interventions are focused on public servants or physicians. I would assume government policy experts and healthcare administrators are key targets in this message. 
Do you think the storyline is persuasive enough to inspire action in the intended audience? If it is not persuasive, are there modifications that you would recommend? | Yeah, I think the tangentals about how this means to the individual is key. It is hard to relate to massive loss on a large scale. If this is meant for a federal budget expert, I would assume only then would large losses be concerning enough to act on or intervene. 
Is there anything you find surprising or confusing? | I had not know that healthcare waste equals to defense expenditures (which we have a very large portion of the federal budget go towards). 
Is there anything you would change or do differently? | I would demonstrate how healthcare costs savings can resolve a problem (rather than just watching Taylor Swift) as to demonstrate large scale impact as well. 
Is there any additional information you would like to know? | N.A
