## A.Outline
#### High level summary: The United States is not prioritizing on the right solutions when it comes to dealing with the problems in the healthcare industry.
I will be using a model which I have modified for my undergraudate thesis to derive insights for the US healthcare system. This model is comparing between the healthcare system of 30 OECD countries and Singapore. My story will be using lessons learnt from this model to see if the current debate on the US healthcare reforms is in the right direction.

#### Aim
As a reader, I want to lobby for a more sensible healthcare system so that I can recieve better healthcare quality and experience lower healthcare cost.    

Another aim is to see if I can redesign my orignal visualizations to make it better for consumption by the general public. I want to test if I can make academic research more acceptable to them.  

#### Structure of Storyline (from Good Charts text)
Setup: This is the parts of a healthcare system 

Conflict: America is not doing well compared to other countries and the debate on healthcare is not in the right direction 

Resolution: The debate on healthcare should change to focus in another direction. 

## B.Data
The dataset I am using is from my undergraduate thesis research.

Besides redesigning the exisitng vizualizations, I will be going to do a deeper dive in the 'regulation' indicator  

## C.Method and Medium
I will be using Shorthand to show my story.
