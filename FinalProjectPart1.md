## A.Outline
### High level summary: The United States is not prioritizing on the right solutions when it comes to dealing with the problems in the healthcare industry.
I will be using a model which I have modified for my undergraudate thesis to derive insights for the US healthcare system. This model is comparing between the healthcare system of 30 OECD countries and Singapore. My story will be using lessons learnt from this model to see if the current debate on the US healthcare reforms is in the right direction.

### Aim
As a reader, I want to lobby for a more sensible healthcare system so that I can recieve better healthcare quality and experience lower healthcare cost.    

Another aim is to see if I can redesign my orignal visualizations to make it better for consumption by the general public. I want to test if I can make academic research more acceptable to them.  

### Structure of Storyline (from Good Charts text)
- Setup: This is the parts of a healthcare system 
- Conflict: America is not doing well compared to other countries and the debate on healthcare is not in the right direction 
- Resolution: The debate on healthcare should change to focus in another direction. 

## B.Data
The dataset I am using is from my undergraduate thesis research.

Picture A was the model that I worked on in my thesis.  Each step in the model contains several indicators.
- Monetary input --> Total health expenditure as a percentage of Gross Domestic Product (GDP); Expenditure on a per capita basis and government’s share of the expenditure. Taken from [WHO (2013). Global Health Expenditure Database.] (http://apps.who.int/nha/database/Select/Indicators/en)

- Real input --> number (per 1000 population) of healthcare personnel of hospital bed, nurses, physicians, dentists, and pharmacists
Taken from [2013 OECD data](https://stats.oecd.org/index.aspx?queryid=30183) unless otherwise stated in the Picture B below.

- Real output --> health outcome. Taken from [OECD’s Health Care Quality Indicators project (HCQI)](http://www.oecd.org/els/health-systems/health-care-quality-indicators.html) unless othwe wise stated in Picture B below. Half of the real output refers to primary care and other half refers to acute care.

This model was used to compare between the different health systems from source C.E.g. the ratio betwwen monetary input and real input of USA is compared to the UK to see how efficient the money is used to pay for healthcare provision.

The exisitng vizualizations will be redesigned as it will probably need to more streamlined to be more persuasive. Currently, they have too much infomarmation and less specific to the US audience. The vizualizations will focus on on how the American perfrom relative to the other systems. Depending of the length of the story, I might be doing a deeper dive in the 'regulation' indicator to see if there are additional insights for America.
