## A.Outline
#### High level summary: The United States is not prioritizing on the right solutions when it comes to dealing with the problems in the healthcare industry.
I will be using a model which I have modified for my undergraudate thesis to derive insights for the US healthcare system. This model is comparing between the healthcare system of 30 OECD countries and Singapore. My story will be using lessons learnt from this model to see if the current debate on the US healthcare reforms is in the right direction.

#### Aim
As a reader, I want to lobby for a more sensible healthcare system so that I can recieve better healthcare quality and experience lower healthcare cost.    

#### Structure of Storyline (from Good Charts text)
Setup: This is the parts of a healthcare system 
Conflict: America is not doing well compared to other countries and the debate on healthcare is not in the right direction 
Resolution: The debate on healthcare should change to focus in another direction.
