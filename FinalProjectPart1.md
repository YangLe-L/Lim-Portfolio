#### High level summary: The United States is not prioritizing on the right solutions when it comes to dealing with the problems in the healthcare industry.
I will be using a model which I have modified for my undergraudate thesis to derive insights for the US healthcare system.

My story will be using lessons learnt from this model to see if the current debate on the US healthcare reforms is in the right direction.
