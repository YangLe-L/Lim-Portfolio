Title: Is The US Healthcare System Wasting Too Much Money? A Re-Look On The Extent Of The Monetary Waste

## A. The Idea (Origin)
### A.1.The project outline, high-level summary, and project structure that outlines the major elements of my story remain the same. They are found in Part A of [Final Project Part 1 Version 2](/FinalProjectPart1_V2.md)

### A.2.My data source(s), an explanation of how I plan on using my data & links 
In addtion to those found in Part B of [Final Project Part 1 Version 2](/FinalProjectPart1_V2.md), I have included other datasets to complement the healthcare waste and savings data.
- Used healthcare expenditutre per capita, life expentency, and infant mortality rate to show how the healthcare system is not cost-effective.
- Used the federal budget data to compare with the healthcare waste to show the seriousness of the waste.
- Used prices from a CNBC website to show how many things can be bought by saving on healthcare waste.
