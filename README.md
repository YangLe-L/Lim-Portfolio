I am a student studying Master of Science in Public Policy and Management (DC Track). I will be spending my first year in Pittsburgh at CMU and doing a fellowship while studying in Washington DC for my second year. I have a habit of trying to find the right way to do things, be it the most efficient, fair or accurate way. As such, I plan to be a public policy analyst in the future where I can use my analytical skills to promote evidence-based thinking in the public sector. If there is unsound policy, it will have huge ramifications on society. 

My current policy interests are in the education and health sector. Specifically, I am exploring how to improve the quality and equity of education in equipping relevant skills for all segments of society; and identify the best way to organize a healthcare system.          

# What I hope to learn 
From this data visualization course, I hope to learn ways to improve my ability to design data to communicate and persuade my audience. Currently, my visualization skills are stuck at the Excel level, which I think is insufficient to achieve my career goal of being a public policy analyst who can influence others to take up evidence-based thinking and believe in my analysis.
