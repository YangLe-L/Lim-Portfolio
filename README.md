# About me
![my photo](https://github.com/YangLe-L/Lim-Portfolio/blob/master/Yang%20Le%20photo.jpg)
I am a student studying Master of Science in Public Policy and Management (DC Track). I will be spending my first year in Pittsburgh at CMU and doing a fellowship while studying in Washington DC for my second year. I plan to be a public policy analyst in the future where I can use my analytical skills to promote evidence-based thinking in the public sector.     

# What I hope to learn 
From this data visualization course, I hope to learn ways to improve my ability to use data to communicate and persuade my audience. Currently, my visualization skills are stuck at the Excel level :cry:,which I think is insufficient to achieve my career goal of being a public policy analyst who is promoting evidence-based thinking.
