## A.Outline
### High-level summary: Healthcare waste is a huge problem in the United States that needs to be tackled now.

I find that the statistics on healthcare waste tend not to inspire follow-up actions. The statistics can sometimes be too abstract or too detached from everyday life for readers to know the seriousness of the issue.     

### Aim
As a reader, I want to lobby for a more sensible healthcare system so that I can receive better healthcare quality and experience lower healthcare costs. 

As a reader, I want to identify/prioritize the waste that I can tackle by creating a business solution.   
  

### Structure of Storyline 
- Setup: This is what healthcare waste look like
- Conflict: 
- Conflict 2: Democrat idea of Medicare-for-all might not work as well as planned. 
- Resolution: There are better ways to reform the healthcare system (e.g. focusing on primary healthcare)  

## B.Data
The main dataset I am using is from my undergraduate thesis research. Other data that I am still looking for related to the resolution and Medicare-for-all portion.  

#### [Academic Website](https://repository.ntu.edu.sg/handle/10356/76200)

#### [PDF Acess to my Thesis](/FYP_LIM YANG LE.pdf)

#### [Healthcare System Type](http://edoc.vifapol.de/opus/volltexte/2012/4221/pdf/AP_165_2012.pdf) (Böhm, K., Schmid, A., Götze, R., Landwehr, C., & Rothgang, H. (2012). Classifying OECD healthcare systems: A deductive approach. TranState Working Papers,165.)

#### [Raw dataset](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1JKWSXGfJOcLVwoOWvzlEg3Vd_PO5TYaO?usp=sharing)

Picture A was the model that I worked on in my thesis.  Each step in the model contains several indicators.
- Monetary input --> Total health expenditure as a percentage of Gross Domestic Product (GDP); Expenditure on a per capita basis and government’s share of the expenditure. Taken from [WHO (2013). Global Health Expenditure Database.] (http://apps.who.int/nha/database/Select/Indicators/en)

- Real input --> number (per 1000 population) of healthcare personnel of hospital bed, nurses, physicians, dentists, and pharmacists
Taken from [2013 OECD data](https://stats.oecd.org/index.aspx?queryid=30183) unless otherwise stated in Picture B below.

- Real output --> health outcome. Taken from [OECD’s Health Care Quality Indicators project (HCQI)](https://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=HEALTH_HCQI) unless otherwise stated in Picture B below. Half of the real output refers to primary care and other half refers to acute care.

This model was used to compare the different health systems. E.g. the ratio between monetary input and real input of USA is compared to the UK to see how efficient the money is used to pay for healthcare provision.

The existing visualizations will be redesigned as it will probably need to more streamlined to be more persuasive. Currently, they have too much information and less specific to the US audience. The visualizations will focus on how America perform relative to the other systems. Depending on the length of the story, I might be doing a deeper dive into the 'regulation' indicator to see if there are additional insights for America.  


## C.Method and Medium
I will be using Shorthand to show my story. Tools like datwrapper, tableau, and rawgraphs will be used to create the charts needed to drive my story. 
The plan for the next two weeks are:
- week 1: generating the charts with story outline for feedback
- week 2: refine the charts and story outline; transferred it to Shorthand
